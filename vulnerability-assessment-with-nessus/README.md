# Home Network Vulnerability Assessment Using Nessus

## Overview

This project documents an internal vulnerability assessment of a home network to identify potential security weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker with internal access. The objective was to evaluate overall exposure, validate significant findings, and assess real-world risk rather than simply collect raw scan output.

---

## Environment

**Scan Host:** ThinkPad T14s Gen 4  
**Operating System:** Fedora Linux 43 (KDE)  
**Network Scope:** 10.0.0.0/24  

**Projected assets in scope:**

- Home router  
- Personal workstations  
- Smart TV  
- Mobile devices  

---

## Tools Used

- Fedora Linux  
- Nessus Essentials (Version 10.11.1)  

---

## Methodology

The assessment followed a standard internal vulnerability management workflow:

1. Deploy Nessus Essentials on a local Linux host  
2. Configure an internal network vulnerability scan  
3. Identify and analyze high-impact findings  
4. Validate significant vulnerabilities to reduce false positives  
5. Assess overall risk to the environment  

---

## Nessus Installation and Setup

Nessus Essentials was installed locally on the scanning host using the official Tenable package.

Steps performed:

1. Downloaded Nessus 10.11.1 for Fedora x86_64  
2. Installed using the system package manager  
3. Started and enabled the Nessus service  
4. Accessed the web interface at https://localhost:8834  
5. Completed activation and initial configuration  

---

## Scan Configuration

**Scan Type:** Advanced Scan  

**Scan Name:** Home Network Internal Vulnerability Assessment  

**Target Network:**

- 10.0.0.0/24  

**Discovery Settings:**

- Full port scanning enabled  
- Service discovery enabled  
- Operating system detection enabled  

Due to Nessus Essentials licensing limitations, the scan was restricted to four hosts.

---

## Assets Identified

The following internal hosts were identified and scanned:

| IP Address | Device Type        |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 10.0.0.240| Fedora Workstation |
| 10.0.0.1  | Network Gateway    |
| 10.0.0.103| SIP IP Phone       |
| 10.0.0.123| iPhone 14 Pro      |

---

## Scan Results Summary

A total of **76 vulnerabilities** were identified across all scanned hosts.

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0     |
| High     | 2     |
| Medium   | 2     |
| Low      | 2     |
| Info     | 70    |

Most findings were informational and related to device fingerprinting and configuration enumeration.

## Key Findings Analysis

### CVE-2025-62171 – ImageMagick Vulnerability

**Severity:** High  

**Description:**  
Nessus reported a vulnerability related to ImageMagick that may allow memory corruption under specific conditions.

**Analysis:**  
This finding was reviewed and determined to be a false positive for this environment, as the vulnerability primarily affects 32-bit systems. All scanned systems were running 64-bit operating systems.

**Conclusion:**  
No remediation required for the current environment.

---

### SIP SSL Anonymous Cipher Suites Supported

**Severity:** Low  

**Description:**  
The SIP IP phone was found to support anonymous SSL cipher suites, preventing proper authentication of remote hosts.

**Risk:**  
This configuration could enable man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker gains access to the internal network.

**Contextual Assessment:**  

- The SIP phone is isolated on a separate VLAN  
- No external access path exists into the internal network  

**Conclusion:**  
Risk is currently low, but should be remediated as a best practice.

**Recommendation:**

- Disable anonymous and weak cipher suites on SIP devices  
- Enforce modern TLS configurations

## Risk Assessment

The most significant risk identified was the potential for internal exploitation of misconfigured services. Although no critical true-positive vulnerabilities were discovered, this assessment demonstrates how unpatched or weakly configured internal systems can increase lateral movement risk in enterprise environments.

---

## Remediation Strategy

Recommended defensive actions include:

1. Maintain regular patching of all endpoints  
2. Remove or harden unnecessary exposed services  
3. Enforce baseline configuration standards  
4. Perform routine internal vulnerability assessments  

---

## Conclusion

This assessment demonstrates the value of internal vulnerability scanning as a proactive defensive control. Rather than treating scanning as a compliance exercise, this project emphasizes validation, risk analysis, and practical remediation.

All scanned endpoints were fully patched, and no critical true-positive vulnerabilities were identified at this time. This reflects a strong baseline security posture for the current environment.
