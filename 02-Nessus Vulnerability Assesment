Home Network Vulnerability Assessment Using Nessus
Overview

This project documents an internal vulnerability assessment of a home network to identify potential security weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker with internal access. The objective was to evaluate overall exposure, validate significant findings, and assess real-world risk rather than simply collect scan output.

Environment

Scan Host: ThinkPad T14s Gen 4
Operating System: Fedora Linux 43 (KDE)

Network Scope: 10.0.0.0/24

Projected assets in scope included:

Home router (gateway)

Personal workstations

Smart TV

Mobile devices

Tools Used

Fedora Linux

Nessus Essentials (Version 10.11.1)

Methodology

The assessment followed a standard internal vulnerability management workflow:

Deployed Nessus Essentials on a Fedora Linux system

Configured an internal authenticated-style network scan

Identified and analyzed high-impact findings

Validated significant vulnerabilities to reduce false positives

Assessed overall risk to the environment

Nessus Installation and Setup

Nessus Essentials was installed locally on the scanning host using the official Tenable package.

Steps performed:

Downloaded Nessus 10.11.1 for Fedora x86_64

Installed using the system package manager

Started and enabled the Nessus service

Accessed the web interface at https://localhost:8834

Completed activation and initial configuration

Scan Configuration

Scan Type: Advanced Scan

Scan Name: Home Network Internal Vulnerability Assessment

Target Network:

10.0.0.0/24

Discovery Configuration:

Full port scanning enabled

Service discovery enabled

Operating system detection enabled

Due to Nessus Essentials licensing limits, the scan was restricted to four hosts.

Assets Identified

The following internal hosts were scanned:

IP Address	Device Type
10.0.0.240	Fedora Workstation
10.0.0.1	Network Gateway
10.0.0.103	SIP IP Phone
10.0.0.123	iPhone 14 Pro
